A Short Neural Network in JavaScript
====================================
Due to the paucity of Neural Networks built in JavaScript and my interest in
JavaScript and my education in Computer Science and Information Systems as well
as Psychology(which also deals with Neural Networks)-- I thought I would upload
this quick implementation of a neural network, in JavaScript, which can be run
from the command line as a Node.js app. Although it is not the most efficient
implementation it consists of few lines of code. It uses the [Brain.js Project](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js),
designed to classify the ubiquitous, Iris Datasheet.
